### A note to release managers

When creating a new release in GitHub, please copy the `[Unreleased]` section to a new versioned
section and use it for the release's notes, in addition to verifying that version numbers are
updated throughout the repository.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Using a literal string in macro annotations will now be interpreted as an expression. This makes
  it possible to inject values by running functions and using types such as `Some(42)` with
  comparison operators. To inject string literals into macro attributes you will now now need to
  escape the literal quotes like so: `#[validatron(equal = "\"Foo\"")]`

## v0.1.1

### Added
- `std::containers::HashSet` now implements `Validate` along with the other stdlib containers.

## v0.1.0

### Added
- Initial release of `Validatron`
- enums are now supported in their various forms
- added the `predicate` field attribute validator for functions that return bool
- rename `ErrorBuilder::at_*` functions to `ErrorBuilder::try_at_*`
- added new `ErrorBuilder::at_*` functions which will construct errors at the given location
